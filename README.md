# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
Capstone Project



## Overview

This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to uncover valuable insights that can help improve customer experience, optimize room allocation, and identify trends in guest preferences. The analysis covers multiple aspects of hotel operations, including booking patterns, customer sources, reservation statuses, and meal/stay preferences.

The end-to-end workflow involves **extracting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing** data, using industry-standard tools such as **SQL, Microsoft Excel, and Power BI**. The project follows a clear MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) framework to ensure a structured and comprehensive approach to analysis.

## üìÇ Data Extraction & Structure

* **Data Source:** The dataset is provided in CSV format and can be directly downloaded from this repository.
* **Tables Included:**

  * `Booking Details`: Contains guest booking information and metadata.
  * `Booking Source & History`: Tracks the source channels and historical booking trends.
  * `Room Details`: Information on room types and associated features.
  * `Reservation Status`: Status of each booking (confirmed, canceled, no-show, etc.).
  * `Meal & Stay Preferences`: Captures guest preferences for meals and stay services.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Cleaning & ETL Process

* Performed thorough **data cleaning** to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
* Applied an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process to prepare the data for analysis and visualization.
* Used SQL scripts and Excel functions to transform raw data into clean, analysis-ready tables.

---

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Conducted EDA using **Microsoft Excel** for initial summaries, pivot tables, and charts.
* Leveraged **SQL queries** for deeper data slicing, trend identification, and key metric calculations.
* Analyzed:

  * Booking trends over time.
  * Room type performance.
  * Lead times and cancellation patterns.
  * Customer segments and booking sources.
  * Meal plan preferences and stay durations.

## üìä Dashboard & Visualizations

* **Power BI Dashboard:**

  * Developed an interactive dashboard highlighting key metrics and trends.
  * Included dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-down visuals for actionable insights.
  * Visualized KPIs such as occupancy rates, revenue trends, top customer segments, and seasonal patterns.

* **Excel Report:**

  * Supplemented the Power BI dashboard with detailed Excel reports for quick tabular views and manual analysis.

* **Presentation Slides:**

  * Created a concise slide deck summarizing findings, insights, and strategic recommendations for stakeholders.
